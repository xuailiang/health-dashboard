# Apple Health Dashboard

A privacy-first, client-side dashboard for visualizing your Apple Health (and optional Garmin) export. Drop the unzipped folder, get interactive charts. Nothing leaves your browser.

## How it works

1. On iPhone: **Settings → Health → Export All Health Data**
2. Unzip the export to a folder
3. Open the dashboard and select that folder
4. Browse your data across 18 tabs grouped into 5 sections

Optional: select a Garmin Connect export folder instead — the dashboard parses Garmin's `DI_CONNECT/*.json` for training-readiness, ATL/CTL, race predictions, fitness age, and more.

## Tabs

### Dashboard
| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Overview** | At-a-Glance tiles with sparklines, week/month charts, **Trends** (multi-window: 7d / 14d / 30d, sparkline-per-window), **AI Insights** (inline) |
| **Score** | Composite health score 0–100 with sub-component breakdown |

### Health
| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Cardio** | VO2 Max + fitness age, Resting HR & HRV overlay, Walking HR, HR Recovery, HR Range band, Cardiac Efficiency |
| **Body** | Weight + Lean Mass, Body Fat %, BMI |
| **Sleep** | Stage stack, latency, WASO, consistency, sleep timing, temperature, breathing disturbances, SpO2 |
| **Cycle** | Cycle length, period duration, flow distribution, basal body temperature |
| **Daylight** | Daily exposure, seasonal pattern, year-over-year monthly average |
| **Audio** | Headphone & environmental noise vs WHO safe thresholds |

### Fitness
| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Mobility** | Walking speed, step length, double-support, asymmetry, flights climbed, stair speed, steadiness, 6-min walk |
| **Running** | Power, pace, stride length, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, form overview |
| **Training** | Garmin readiness, VO2, performance scores, ATL/CTL, race predictions, stress, sleep scores, fitness age, heat & altitude, hydration |
| **Training Load** | Fitness/Fatigue/Form (CTL/ATL/TSB), weekly load |

### Activities
| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Calendar** | GitHub-style heatmap, metric-selectable, per year |
| **Trainings** | Workout type breakdown + per-session detail (GPS route, HR, pace, elevation, splits) |
| **Compare** | Auto-detected repeated routes — pace/speed progression overlaid |
| **Heatmap** | All GPS routes on one map with frequency coloring |

### Trends & Analysis
| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Correlations** | Scatter plots with Pearson r, rolling correlation strength |
| **Yearly** | Year-over-year comparison table with % changes |

## Technical highlights

- **1GB+ XML parsed in-browser** via a Web Worker with 64MB streaming chunks and regex extraction — no DOM parser
- **Apple-Health-specific date parser** — Safari's `Date` constructor rejects `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ±ZZZZ"`; we parse it manually so HR timelines and sleep stage timing work cross-browser
- **Source deduplication** — iPhone + Apple Watch step/distance/energy records deduplicated by max-per-source-per-day; Watch sleep stages preferred over iPhone's `AsleepUnspecified`
- **Multi-window trend detection** — for each curated metric, compares avg(last N) vs avg(prior N) across 7/14/30-day windows with shared y-scale sparklines
- **IndexedDB cache** — parsed data persisted client-side so reloads are instant
- **Lazy loading** — each tab is code-split; Recharts and Leaflet in separate chunks
- **Optional Garmin source** — same dashboard, parses Garmin Connect JSON exports for richer training metrics
- **Privacy** — zero network requests for your data. All parsing, analysis, and rendering happens locally.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript 5
- Vite 8
- Recharts (charts)
- Leaflet + react-leaflet (maps)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Lucide React (icons)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # localhost:5173
npm run build    # static dist/
npm run lint
```

## Data format

Parses Apple Health's `export.xml` (or localized variants like `exportacion.xml`). HealthKit identifiers are language-independent API constants, so any export language works.

Also reads:
- `electrocardiograms/*.csv` — ECG waveform data at 512Hz (used by `TrainingViewer` when present)
- `workout-routes/*.gpx` — GPS tracks with speed and elevation

For Garmin Connect: select an unzipped Garmin export folder containing `DI_CONNECT/`. The parser reads training readiness, VO2 Max, endurance/hill scores, ATL/CTL, race predictions, heat & altitude acclimation, fitness age, daily stress, hydration, and sleep scores.
